# HTML interview questions along with their answers

1. What is HTML, and what does it stand for?<br>
   HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." It is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. HTML uses various tags and attributes to define the elements and their properties within a web page.

2. Explain the purpose of HTML tags and attributes.<br>
   HTML tags are used to define the elements that make up the structure of a web page. Tags are placed around content to indicate its type and define how it should be displayed. Attributes provide additional information or settings for HTML elements, and they are placed inside the opening tag.

3. What are semantic HTML elements, and why are they important?<br>
   Semantic HTML elements provide meaning and context to the content within a web page. They help both developers and browsers understand the purpose of the content, improving accessibility, search engine optimization, and code readability.

4. How do you create a hyperlink in HTML?<br>
   To create a hyperlink, you use the anchor `<a>` element with the `href` attribute, which specifies the destination URL. For example: `<a href="https://www.example.com">Click Here</a>`

5. What is the difference between the `<div>` and `<span>` elements in HTML?<br>
   The `<div>` element is a block-level element, meaning it takes up the full width of its container and creates a new line before and after it. The `<span>` element, on the other hand, is an inline element, and it only takes up the space it needs without creating new lines.

6. What is the purpose of the "alt" attribute in the `<img>` element?<br>
   The "alt" attribute in the `<img>` element provides alternative text for the image. It is used when the image cannot be displayed, helping visually impaired users and improving the accessibility of the page.

7. How do you add comments in HTML?<br>
   You can add comments in HTML using the `<!--` and `-->` delimiters. Everything between these delimiters will be considered a comment and will not be rendered on the web page.

8. Explain the difference between block-level and inline elements in HTML.<br>
   Block-level elements take up the full width of their container and create a new line before and after them. They can contain other block-level and inline elements. Examples include `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>` to `<h6>`. Inline elements, on the other hand, only take up the space they need and do not create new lines. They can only contain other inline elements. Examples include `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<strong>`.

9. What is the "doctype" declaration, and why is it important in HTML?<br>
   The "doctype" declaration (`<!DOCTYPE>`) specifies the version of HTML being used in the document. It is important because it informs the web browser about the document type and allows it to render the page correctly. Modern web pages typically use the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, which is the HTML5 standard.

10. How do you embed audio or video files in HTML?<br>
    You can embed audio or video files in HTML using the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, respectively. These elements allow you to specify the source of the audio or video file using the `src` attribute. Additionally, you can use the `<source>` element inside these elements to provide multiple formats for better browser compatibility.
